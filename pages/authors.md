For each of the **{{site.data.biography | size}}+ authors** in our continuously growing dataset! They all have a profile that contains a brief biographical summary, with links to the author's <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> and various <a href="https://www.dloc.com/" target="_blank">DLOC resources</a>. The author bibliography is displayed as a scrollable vertical timeline in ascending order of publication.

Author profiles generally include new editions, translations and significant reprints of their original works.
