### Welcome to the Six Degree of Separation Activity 


This activity is all about seeing the connection we have among the Caribbean Literary Diaspora. Currently in our dataset we have basic information such as  Author's first name, last name , country of birth , and birth year, death year (if applicable). 

#### Historical Context of Activity

<blockquote>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon or Bacon's Law is a parlor game where players challenge each other to choose an actor whom they connect to another actor via a film in which both actors appeared: this is repeated to try to find the shortest path that leads to prolific American actor Kevin Bacon. It rests on the assumption that anyone involved in the Hollywood film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps. The game's name is a reference to "six degrees of separation", a concept that posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart.
