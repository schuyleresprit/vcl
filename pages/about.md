__The Project__


Writing in and about the Caribbean has been documented across anthologies, bibliographies and critical analyses. In the spaces where Caribbean literary studies and digital humanities meet, there has already been rich exploration of Caribbean literary history. This project builds on existing work in Caribbean digital literary studies, including [In the Same Boats][1], [Caribbean Literary Heritage][2] and the 2020 effort of [The Caribbean Digital VII][3] to create a database of [Caribbean digital scholarship][4], collectively annotate the works of Aimé Césaire and produce a generative collection of keywords that inform the constellation of Caribbean Studies.

VCL aims to contribute to and open the way for further critical engagement with Caribbean literary history, including teaching of literature in primary and secondary contexts.  Moreover, WRS adds the dimension of the literary reception as a key component for visualizing the breadth and depth of Caribbean communities.



__The Assignment__


Create Caribbean interns enrolled in HIS115 for the academic year 2021-22 will contribute to this project by working to develop a multimedia resource documenting Caribbean literary history, particularly with a searchable, annotated, and mapped timeline of Caribbean literature from 1800 – the present.
