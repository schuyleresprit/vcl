The individual student projects completed under the theme Visualizing Caribbean Literature are as vast and diverse as the idea of Caribbean literature itself. The studentsâ€™ work reflects their attention to the complexity and variety of experiences and stories of Caribbean being - in the past, present and future. Student projects have been organized into three broad categories.
