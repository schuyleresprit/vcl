alowe,Adam Lowe,Anish Kapoor,"Throughout his creative career, Turner Prize-winning sculptor Anish Kapoor has worked extensively with architects and engineers, and built a large body of public works that merge sculpture and architecture. Now, in a world designed using CAD programs, Kapoor argues that the next logical step in integrating design with production is to move from virtual models to 3D-printed buildings. In Unconformity and Entropy, a number of finished architectural works are fleshed out with preparatory studies and extracts from the artist's extensive technical research, illustrating his investigation of the fluid and plastic qualities of cement. Central to the project is the conceit of the use of a purpose-built machine to generate forms through which Kapoor would explore the intersection of idea and event. Extensively illustrated with original drawings, sketches and color photographs, and superbly designed, Unconformity and Entropy also includes several illuminating introductory essays.",,alowe6,2009,English,Turner Publishing Company,,,,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Anish-Kapoor-Unconformity-Simon-Schaffer/dp/847506891X,#,#,,-86.8419,36.152,66thand2nd

arsantos,Alaí Reyes-Santos,Our Caribbean Kin: Race And Nation In The Neoliberal Antilles,"Beset by the forces of European colonialism, US imperialism, and neoliberalism, the people of the Antilles have had good reasons to band together politically and economically, yet not all Dominicans, Haitians, and Puerto Ricans have heeded the calls for collective action. So what has determined whether Antillean solidarity movements fail or succeed? In this comprehensive new study, Alaí Reyes-Santos argues that the crucial factor has been the extent to which Dominicans, Haitians, and Puerto Ricans imagine each other as kin. 


Our Caribbean Kin considers three key moments in the region’s history: the nineteenth century, when the antillanismo movement sought to throw off the yoke of colonial occupation; the 1930s, at the height of the region’s struggles with US imperialism; and the past thirty years, as neoliberal economic and social policies have encroached upon the islands. At each moment, the book demonstrates, specific tropes of brotherhood, marriage, and lineage have been mobilized to construct political kinship among Antilleans, while racist and xenophobic discourses have made it difficult for them to imagine themselves as part of one big family. 

 

Recognizing the wide array of contexts in which Antilleans learn to affirm or deny kinship, Reyes-Santos draws from a vast archive of media, including everything from canonical novels to political tracts, historical newspapers to online forums, sociological texts to local jokes. Along the way, she uncovers the conflicts, secrets, and internal hierarchies that characterize kin relations among Antilleans, but she also discovers how they have used notions of kinship to create cohesion across differences.",,arsantos1,2015,English,Rutgers University Press,"New Brunswick, NJ",United States,new_brunswick_nj_united¬†states,Nonfiction,,y,https://www.amazon.com/Our-Caribbean-Kin-Neoliberal-Antilles/dp/0813571995,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Our_Caribbean_Kin/yAtmCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT7&printsec=frontcover,#,244,-74.4472,40.4975,Bokeh

Presencia de justificado erotismo en las historias, donde la sutileza alterna con carnalidad rotunda y roza en ocasiones lo escatológico en función de hilvanar conflictos, anécdotas, atmósferas… Diversidad temática, que escapa a la monotonía. Uso apropiado de la titulación, a tono con la naturaleza de los textos propuestos. Presentación de variados ambientes y maneras de narrar, que aporta complejidad al volumen en su propuesta ideo-estética: del barroco a la sencillez extrema; de la parquedad a la exuberancia; del realismo rampante a la fantasía desmesurada; de la obviedad al enigma.

aisfahanihammond,Alexandra Isfahani-Hammond,The Masters And The Slaves: Plantation Relations And Mestizaje In American Imaginaries,"This collection presents a comparative study of the impact of slavery on the literary and cultural imagination of the Americas, and also on the impact of writing on slavery on the social legacies of slavery's history. The chapters examine the relationship of slavery and master/slave relations to nationalist projects throughout the Americas - the ways in which a history of slavery and its abolition has shaped a nation's identity and race relations within that nation. The scope of the study is unprecedented - the book ties together the entire 'Black Atlantic', including the French and Spanish Caribbean, the US, and Brazil. Through reading texts on slavery and its legacy from these countries, the volume addresses the eroticization of the plantation economy, various formations of the master/slave dialectic as it has emerged in different national contexts, the plantation as metaphor, and the relationship between texts that use cultural vs biological narratives of mestizaje (being interracial). These texts are examined with the goal of locating the origins of the different notions of race and racial orders that have arisen throughout the Americas. Isfahani-Hammond argues that without a critical revisiting of slavery and its various incarnations throughout the Americas, it is impossible to understand and rethink race relations in today's world.",,aisfahanihammond1,2005,English,Macmillan Publishers,"New York, NY",United States,new_york_ny_united_states,Nonfiction,,n,https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Slaves-Plantation-Imaginaries-Directions/dp/1403967083,#,#,171,-73.29648773,41.04076571,Kriterion Publishing House

aarthurs,Alexia Arthurs,How To Love a Jamaican: Stories,"Tenderness and cruelty, loyalty and betrayal, ambition and regret—Alexia Arthurs navigates these tensions to extraordinary effect in her debut collection about Jamaican immigrants and their families back home. Sweeping from close-knit island communities to the streets of New York City and midwestern university towns, these eleven stories form a portrait of a nation, a people, and a way of life.

In “Light-Skinned Girls and Kelly Rowlands,” an NYU student befriends a fellow Jamaican whose privileged West Coast upbringing has blinded her to the hard realities of race. In “Mash Up Love,” a twin’s chance sighting of his estranged brother—the prodigal son of the family—stirs up unresolved feelings of resentment. In “Bad Behavior,” a couple leave their wild teenage daughter with her grandmother in Jamaica, hoping the old ways will straighten her out. In “Mermaid River,” a Jamaican teenage boy is reunited with his mother in New York after eight years apart. In “The Ghost of Jia Yi,” a recently murdered student haunts a despairing Jamaican athlete recruited to an Iowa college. And in “Shirley from a Small Place,” a world-famous pop star retreats to her mother’s big new house in Jamaica, which still holds the power to restore something vital.",,aarthurs1,2019,English,Ballantine Books,"New York, NY",United States,new_york_ny_united_states,Fiction (Short Story Collection),,n,#,#,#,239,-73.9814,40.7636,La Habana Ediciones Arte y Lietratura

asalkey,Andrew Salkey,The Adventures Of Catullus Kelly,"Catullus Kelly is a young Jamaican. He is a graduate in English literature and his parents or, more particularly, his mother have sent him to London to improve himself. His mother sends him money so he does not need to work but he does occasionally. The novel starts off on a sort of picaresque journey round London for the young Jamaican. He stays in a rooming house, owned by Erasmus Thompson, a Jamaican who owns various properties in London and is married to Bridie, an Irish woman. Erasmus acts as a guide and mentor to Catullus. It is Erasmus that sends Catullus off on his journey. His first stop is to the White Defence League, where he learns of a book The Shape of Skulls to Come, apparently a racist book written by one Aethelstan Gordon-Venning. He is not allowed to buy the book and spends much of the novel trying to track down both the book and its author. Of course, he ultimately finds both but in an unlikely place. He is next picked up by a white prostitute in a Jaguar, Olga, who ends up paying him. He will see her again. Catullus continues his journey with visits to Soho, where he meets a group of homosexuals, the BBC World Service (wittily called the Temperance Broadcasting Unit - TBU) and a barber's shop staffed by West Indians who spend a lot of time talking but little barbering. He writes a script for the TBU about the homosexuals but is rejected. He takes a job in a comprehensive school as a teacher where the pupils make fun of him and finally accept him. He takes them to a nudie film and nearly loses his job over it. No matter, as he will not return to the job but goes to work in a coffee bar in Leicester Square. All the while Salkey has been poking fun at the British and, indeed, at the West Indians. While négritude is frequently discussed, it is not practised and Salkey is at pains to point out that the Africans look down on the West Indians.",,asalkey11,1969,English,Hutchinson,London,England,london_ldn_england,Fiction (Novel),,n,#,#,#,196,-0.1214343072,51.51026417,University of Massachusetts Press

When Jubo Jubogba began life as a trader’s slave, paddling the great house’s canoes, no one could’ve predicted his meteoric ascent to become Ja Ja of Opobo, a sage merchant king of the Niger’s rich river delta.

akellman,Anthony Kellman,The Houses of Alphonso,"Barbadian-born Alphonso Hutson has lived in the USA for nearly sixteen years. But he cannot settle. He has dragged his long-suffering American wife, Simone, and their children from house to rented house. He has refused to share with her any real explanation for the complex feelings that drive him. But this time she has had enough of his 'sorry restlessness', refuses to move with him and threatens the end of their marriage. Only then is Alphonso forced into confronting the ghosts that propel his perpetual migrancy.

The ghosts lie in his native Barbados. There is the love, shame and guilt he feels for the dead parents whose funerals he failed to attend, and there is the mystery of the brother he has never seen, hidden away in an institution. All is complicated by his mixed feelings for his homeland. It is the place that still feeds his imagination, but as a boy from a Black working class family he has felt excluded from the class structures of a country still dominated by a privileged White minority.

There is also the family house, locked up and at risk of being vandalised and Alphonso finally recognises that he cannot put off making a return, the first since his departure. In what follows Kellman combines a poetic and imaginative exploration of Alphonso's personal journey into his past, with an acute engagement with racial and political issues as he rediscovers his country in the midst of turmoil as the old order is challenged.",,akellman8,2003,English,Peepal Tree Press,Leeds,England,leeds_england,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Houses-Alphonso-Anthony-Kellman/dp/1900715821/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=9D3dB&content-id=amzn1.sym.0fb2cce1-1ca4-439a-844b-8ad0b1fb77f7&pf_rd_p=0fb2cce1-1ca4-439a-844b-8ad0b1fb77f7&pf_rd_r=134-1877149-6260107&pd_rd_wg=QiYxd&pd_rd_r=73d1bb3f-fa96-4a6a-9efd-5c368744aba6&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk,"https://search.lib.uiowa.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01IOWA_ALMA21410486670002771&context=L&vid=01IOWA&lang=en_US&search_scope=default_scope&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=default_tab&query=creator,exact,Kellman,%20Tony%201955-,,AND&mode=advanced&offset=0",#,304,-1.5694,53.8062,Writer's Showcase

abenitezrojo,Antonio Benítez-Rojo,Woman in battle dress,"In 1809, at the age of eighteen, Henriette Faber enrolled herself in medical school in Parisand since medicine was a profession prohibited to women, she changed her name to Henri in order to matriculate. She would spend the next fifteen years practicing medicine and living as a man.

Drafted to serve as a surgeon in Napoleon's army, Faber endured the horrors of the 1812 retreat across Russia. She later embarked to the Caribbean and set up a medical practice in a remote Cuban village, where she married Juana de León, an impoverished local. Three years into their marriage, de León turned Faber in to the authorities, demanding that the marriage be annulled. A sensational legal trial ensued, and Faber was stripped of her medical license, forced to dress as a woman, sentenced to prison, and ultimately sent into exile. She was last seen on a boat headed to New Orleans in 1827.

In this, his last published work, Antonio Benítez Rojo takes the outline provided by historical events and weaves a richly detailed backdrop for Faber, who becomes a vivid and complex figure grappling with the strictures of her time. Woman in Battle Dress is a sweeping, ambitious epic, in which Henriette Faber tells the story of her life, a compelling, entertaining, and ultimately triumphant tale",,abenitezrojo11,2015,English,City Lights Books,"San Francisco, CA",United States,san_franciso_ca_united¬†states,Fiction (Novel),,n,#,#,#,479,-122.4060741,37.79782206,

abenitezrojo,Antonio Benítez-Rojo,A view from the Mangrove,"In this masterful collection of short stories, a celebrated Cuban writer continues his imaginative exploration of the genesis of the modern Caribbean world. Intent on recovering the interior history (la infra-historia) of this astonishingly diverse region, Antonio Benítez-Rojo ranges widely across time and geography. He also experiments with a variety of narrative techniques and prose styles, each intended to capture some unique aspect of the Caribbean's heterogeneous, polyrhythmic cultural heritage. Thus ""The Broken Flute"" centers on a tragic anthropological reflection; ""Windward Passage"" on the confessions of a guilty priest stationed in Hispaniola; ""Summer Island"" on events surrounding the colonization of St. Kitts; and ""A View from the Mangrove"" on the troubled days of a soldier during Cuba's War of Independence. The result is historical fiction of the first order, a vivid tapestry of characters and contexts. Whether describing the world through the eyes of a seventeenth-century African slave or an English slave trader, a French buccaneer or a Spanish official, an Aztec god's avatar or a Haitian grand blanc, Benítez-Rojo displays a rare gift for resurrecting the past in all its chaotic and compelling immediacy",,abenitezrojo5,1998,English,University of Massachusetts Press,"Amherst, MA",United States,amherst_ma_united¬†states,Fiction (Novel),,n,#,#,#,243,-72.5231926,42.39373933,

abenitezrojo,Antonio Benítez-Rojo,Mujer en traje de batalla,"En 1809, a los dieciocho años, Henriette Faber se matriculó en la facultad de medicina de París. Dado que la medicina era una profesión prohibida para las mujeres, cambió su nombre a Henri para matricularse. Pasaría los siguientes quince años ejerciendo la medicina y viviendo como un hombre.

Reclutada para servir como cirujana en el ejército de Napoleón, Faber soportó los horrores de la retirada a través de Rusia en 1812. Posteriormente, se embarcó hacia el Caribe y estableció una consulta médica en un remoto pueblo cubano, donde se casó con Juana de León, una mujer local empobrecida. Tres años después de casarse, de León denunció a Faber ante las autoridades, exigiendo la anulación del matrimonio. Se produjo un juicio sensacionalista, en el que Faber fue despojada de su licencia médica, obligada a vestirse de mujer, condenada a prisión y, finalmente, enviada al exilio. Fue vista por última vez en un barco con destino a Nueva Orleans en 1827.

En esta, su última obra publicada, Antonio Benítez Rojo toma el esquema que ofrecen los acontecimientos históricos y teje un trasfondo rico y detallado para Faber, quien se convierte en una figura vívida y compleja que lidia con las restricciones de su tiempo.

Enrôlée comme chirurgienne dans l'armée de Napoléon, Faber subit les horreurs de la retraite de 1812 en Russie.

The country is on the eve of important elections and the warring political parties have made the divisions between the poor and the wealthy even wider. And Irie and Jilly come from very different backgrounds: Irie is from the heart of Kingston, where fighting in the streets is common. Jilly is from the hills, where mansions nestled within lush gardens remain safe behind gates. But the two bond through a shared love of Reggae music, spending time together at Irie's father's record store, listening to so-called rebel music that opens Jilly's mind to a sound and a way of thinking she's never heard before.

As tensions build in the streets, so do tensions between the two girls. A budding romance between them complicates things further as the push and pull between their two lives becomes impossible to bear. For Irie, fighting—with her words and her voice—is her only option. Blood is shed on the streets in front of her every day. She has no choice. But Jilly can always choose to escape.

bhambley,Barbara Hambly,The Iron Princess,"Something is amiss with the world’s magic. Spells don’t work the way they used to—when they work at all. Only the powers of the Crystal Mages remain as they were, powers founded on the use of the mystical element adamis, the harvesting of which has enslaved the peoples of the Twilight Lands.

They need a hero.

At the same time, ravenous beasts have begun to appear, legendary creatures that seem to be proof against any magic. And Clea Stylachos, granddaughter of a great sage of the Twilight people, has reason to fear that the Crystal Mages, instead of seeking to defeat these insanely destructive monsters, are attempting to weaponize them in their quest for power.

Clea’s only hope to save her people is a wizard who retains his power, one who will not betray her, either to the great merchant houses or to the all-entangling web of the Crystal Mages. But that wizard—Ithrazel the Cursed, destroyer of a city and magically imprisoned to suffer undying, unremitting torment—wants nothing to do with saving the world, helping a hero, or unraveling the terrible secret at the heart of the Crystal Mages’ plans.

From the slums and tunnels of the slave-city of Morne, to the watery wilderness of the Twilight lands, to the halls of her father’s palace and the spell-soaked mysteries of the Crystal Mages’ House of Glass, Clea works to untwist the deadly riddles of magic and monsters—to free her mother’s disenfranchised people from slavery under her father’s conquering forces. To save her mageborn brother from the Crystal Mages’ power; to control a sorcerer legendary for his deed of evil; to keep her own small band of friends one step ahead of her father’s troops and the Crystal Order’s spells.

She is the Iron Princess, and she knows she must prevail or die.

But at what cost to herself?

Archmage Ingold Inglorion believed the source of this monstrous evil lay in the decadent lands to the south. With him traveled Gil Patterson, the scholar-warrior from Earth who had forsaken her own universe for love of the mage.  Determined to aid him in his quest, she was cursed to become the instrument of his death.

Ingold's apprentice Rudy Solis was left behind, the sole wizard standing between the Keep of Dare and the nightmare creatures besieging it.

There she’d met Antryg Windrose, a mad renegade wizard, who, owing to a rather bizarre set of circumstances, now lived with her in sunny California—seemingly as far away as he could get from his former colleagues on the Council of Wizards. Most of them considered him a charlatan…a mere dog wizard who lacked the proper discipline needed to wield magic. Yet when monsters began invading the Council’s world—abominations from across the Void—even those mages not convinced Antryg was responsible knew that he was their best chance of combating the terror.

Ravishing Angelique Crozat, a notorious octoroon who travels in the city's finest company, has been strangled to death.

And it's into this fire that Benjamin January falls when he is hired to follow Oliver Weems, a bank official who has absconded with $100,000 in gold and securities. But it's more than just a job for January. The missing money is vital to the survival of the school for freed slaves that he and his wife Rose have founded.

Following the suspected embezzler—and the money—onto the steamboat Silver Moon, January, Rose, and their friend Hannibal Sefton are sworn to secrecy about the crime until they can find the trunks containing the stolen loot. And then the unexpected happens: Weems is found murdered and suddenly the job of finding the pirated stash grows not only more difficult—but more deadly. There is no shortage of suspects—from the sinister slave-dealer to the bullying steamship pilot to the suspiciously innocent ""lady"" with connections to every river pirate in the riotous port of Natchez-Under-the-Hil—who all seem to have something to hide.

Now, with time running out, January seeks clues wherever he can find them--and allies among whoever can help. Working in tandem with a young planter named Jefferson Davies, he must uncover the dark web of corruption, betrayal, and greed that has already cost one man his life...and, if he can't catch a brutal, remorseless killer, will soon cost January and his friends theirs.",,bhambley32,2004,English,Bantam Spectra,"New York, NY",United States,new_york_ny_united¬†states,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Water-Benjamin-January-Book/dp/0553581562,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Dead_Water/o0tVUPavmDQC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT7&printsec=frontcover,#,320,-73.98255788,40.76523943,

But one of them is Benjamin January, musician and teacher. He well recalls her blazing ebony beauty when she appeared, exquisitely gowned and handy with a stiletto, at a demimonde banquet years ago.

Then the murder is swept from his mind by the delivery of a crate filled with contraband rifles--and yet another telltale boot print left by its claimant.

He was discovered dead one morning, his face twisted in horror, and shortly afterwards Arithmus vanished, never to be seen again.

James,The Black Jacobins: Toussaint l'Ouverture and the San Domingo Revolution,"A powerful and impassioned historical account of the largest successful revolt by enslaved people in history: the Haitian Revolution of 1791–1803. The Black Jacobins, by Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James, was the first major analysis of the uprising that began in the wake of the storming of the Bastille in France and became the model for liberation movements from Africa to Cuba. It is the story of the French colony of San Domingo, a place where the brutality of plantation owners toward enslaved people was horrifyingly severe.

And it is the story of a charismatic and barely literate enslaved person named Toussaint L’Ouverture, who successfully led the Black people of San Domingo against successive invasions by overwhelming French, Spanish, and English forces—and in the process helped form the first independent post-colonial nation in the Caribbean.",,clrjames2,1938,English,Secker & Warburg Ltd.,London,England,(london)_england,Autobiography/Memoir,,n,https://www.amazon.com/Black-Jacobins-Toussaint-LOuverture-Revolution/dp/0679724672,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Black_Jacobins/J-JYEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA4&printsec=frontcover,#,448,-0.1393754227,51.5045974,

Part memoir of a boyhood in a black colony (by one of the founding fathers of African nationalism), part passionate celebration of an unusual and unexpected game, Beyond a Boundary raises, in a warm and witty voice, serious questions about race, class, politics, and the facts of colonial oppression.

clrjames,C. L. R. James,Les Jacobins Noirs : Toussaint Louverture Et La Révolution De Saint-Domingue,"En 1789, les deux tiers du commerce extérieur de la France se faisaient avec sa colonie antillaise de Saint-Domingue, laquelle représentait le plus grand marché de la traite européenne des esclaves. La plus grosse colonie du monde, fierté de la France et objet de convoitise de toutes les autres nations impérialistes, faisait partie intégrante de la vie économique d'alors. Tout cet ensemble reposait sur le labeur d'un demi-million d'esclaves. Au mois d'août 1791, après deux ans de Révolution française avec ses répercussions à Saint-Domingue, les esclaves entrèrent en révolte. Leur lutte dura douze ans. Ils mirent tour à tour en déroute les Blancs locaux et les soldats de la monarchie française, une invasion espagnole, une expédition britannique de près de 60 000 hommes, et un contingent français identique, commandé par le propre beau-frère de Bonaparte. La défaite des troupes napoléoniennes, en 1803, permit l'installation de l'État nègre d'Haïti, qui s'est maintenu jusqu'à nos jours. C'est la seule révolte d'esclaves dont l'histoire ait enregistré le succès. Les obstacles qu'elle dut franchir témoignent de l'importance des intérêts qui étaient en jeu. La transformation des esclaves, qui auparavant tremblaient par centaines face à un seul Blanc, en un peuple capable de s'organiser et de défaire les nations européennes les plus puissantes de l'époque, constitue une des grandes épopées de la bataille et de la réussite révolutionnaires.

cphillips,Caryl Phillips,Foreigners,"A powerful and affecting new book from Caryl a brilliant hybrid of reportage, fiction, and historical fact that tells the stories of three black men whose lives speak resoundingly to the place and role of the foreigner in English society.

Francis Barber, “given” to the great eighteenth-century writer Samuel Johnson, more companion than servant, afforded an unusual depth of freedom that, after Johnson’s death, hastened his wretched demise . . . Randolph Turpin, who made history in 1951 by defeating Sugar Ray Robinson, becoming Britain’s first black world-champion boxer, a top-class fighter for twelve years whose life ended in debt and despair . . . David Oluwale, a Nigerian stowaway who arrived in Leeds in 1949, the events of whose life called into question the reality of English justice, and whose death at the hands of police in 1969 served as a wake-up call for the entire nation.

Each of these men’s stories is rendered in a different, perfectly realized voice. Each illuminates the complexity and drama that lie behind the simple notions of haplessness that have been used to explain the tragedy of these lives. And each explores, in entirely new ways, the themes—at once timeless and urgent—that have been at the heart of all of Caryl Phillips’s remarkable belonging, identity, and race.",,cphillips37,2007,English,Alfred A.

But when Alvin returns home from his grandfather’s funeral a new version of their past emerges, and the two brothers are caught in a desperate struggle to unearth the truth about their existence.",,cphillips2,1981,English,Amber Lane Press,Ambergate,England,ambergate_england,Drama,,n,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VHFJY7G/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Strange_Fruit/LqL8DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT23&printsec=frontcover,#,104,-0.3042237933,51.45743962,

cphillips,Caryl Phillips,Extravagant Strangers: A Literature of Belonging,"Shakespeare called Othello ""an extravagant and wheeling stranger/Of here and every where."" In this exciting anthology, Caryl Phillips has collected writings by thirty-nine extravagant strangers: British writers who were born outside of Britain and see it with clear and critical eyes.  These eloquent and incisive voices prove that English literature, far from being pure or homogenous, has in fact been shaped and influenced by outsiders for over two hundred years.Here are slave writers, such as Ignatius Sancho, an eightieth century African who became a friend to Samuel Johnson and Laurence Sterne; writers born in the colonies such as Thackeray, Kipling, and Orwell; ""subject writers,"" such as C.L.R. James and V.S. Naipaul; foreign émigrés, such as Joseph Conrad and Kazuo Ishiguro; and postcolonial observers of the British scene, such as Salman Rushdie, Ben Okri, and Anita Desai.  With the eloquent and often inspiring collection, Phillips proves, if proof be needed, that the greatest literature is often born out of irreconcilable tensions between a writer and his or her society.",,cphillips1,1977,English,Faber and Faber,London,England,london_ldn_england,Fiction (Novel),Historical Fiction,n,https://www.amazon.com/Extravagant-Strangers-Literature-Caryl-Phillips/dp/0679781544,https://archive.org/details/extravagantstran00cary,#,336,-0.1079740593,51.52131633,

Te väitätte pelastaneenne minut. Poimineenne minut hellävaroin yhdeltä vuosisadalta, auttaneenne minut kahden muun yli ja sitten sijoittaneenne minut tähän aikaan. Mutta miksi? Mitä te yritätte todistaa?

Keskitysleiriltä selvinnyt juutalaistyttö yrittää sopeutua maailmaan joka vielä äsken halusi tappaa hänet, mutta joka yhtäkkiä odottaakin hänen toipuvan kokemuksistaan yhdessä yössä.

Venetsian lähellä vuonna 1480 sattunut kerjäläislapsen sieppaus ja murha antavat tekosyyn ryhtyä vainoon juutalaisia vastaan.

It begins in a year of failing crops and desperate foolishness, which forces a father to sell his three children into slavery. Employing a brilliant range of voices and narrative techniques, Caryl Phillips folows these exiles across the river that separates continents and centuries.

Phillips's characters include a freed slave who journeys to Liberia as a missionary in the 1830s; a pioneer woman seeking refuge from the white man's justice on the Colorado frontier; and an African-American G.I. who falls in love with a white Englishwoman during World War II.

He is separated from his wife of twenty years, kept at arm’s length by his teenage son, estranged from his father, and accused of harassment by a coworker. And beneath it all, he has a desperate feeling that his work—even in fact his life—is no longer relevant.

dflpierreluke,D.F. Les Pierre-Luke,From Pillar To Post,"From Pillar To Post' takes a look at the restlessness of humans in vulnerable situations, especially in intimate relationships that become very traumatic. 'From Pillar To Post' takes the reader through the lives of two very close friends, Donna and David, their individual relationships with their current married, lifelong partners, their continuous affection for each other and eventually their lasting bond between them. Sometimes we 'move on' or 'change' what we think is the best way for our lives and end up worst off than before. We mentally and in some instances, actually create a plan with specific activities that are supposed to fix the many so-called problems we encounter. We never stop to breathe, feel the presence of the Divine or even think things through before acting on our impulses, letting go of the emotions that are so often present with the given situation. Outside influences tested Donna and David's affection for each other, which unfolded a series of events that devastated them, only to realize that they needed to breathe, think and feel the presence of the 'Divine' working within them to achieve their goal. Something they totally neglected. We tend to always look for better when sometimes best is what we already have. Who's to say that we already have the best? Everything we don't have always seems greener on the other side. But is it really? The most tragic of all is when we are in a relationship and the pressure is on. We ask ourselves many questions and answer them ourselves especially when we are hot-tempered. Actually, these are the times we ought not to, but we do anyway. Relationships are fragile connections of emotions, chemistry, passion, intellect, stimulation, eroticism, and attitude and to a large extent lust. Of course this is strictly from a secular perspective. When we explore our hearts truthfully we will find that there are lots more to it. Relationships though intangible have many tangible aspects that should be exercised for prop",,dflpierreluke3,2013,English,Xlibris,,,bloomington_in_united¬†states,Nonfiction Book,,n,https://www.amazon.com/Pillar-Post-D-F-Pierre-Luke/dp/1425745814,#,#,,-86.5757,39.1516,

dflpierreluke,D.F. Les Pierre-Luke,Bullard: Suspicious Finn,"Finn's traumatic life continues even though consciously he got revenge for the gruesome deaths of his parents. The murderers, three businessmen, were lured into his trap and killed. Filled with tremendous complexities, Finn's sexual psychoses, his confused sexual orientation, together with spiritual conflicts and the effects of his early childhood sexual abuse, all compete for recognition in his personality, characteristics that can easily be associated with a psychopath. His thoughts raged like the repeated clicking of a camera's shutter, as each mental image battle with the other for prominence. His actions, though appearing to be 'normal' by the onlooker, are far from the average person's perception. Suspicions about Finn's actions, the shocking death of a neighbour and the three businessmen who mysteriously went missing, reign heavily in Conservation Heights and the surrounding neighbourhood, Riverdale Place being the closest town. There has been much talk about these occurrences with direct links to the night walker, a tall, black, muscular man, who is now bareback, with black fitted running shorts, matching shoes and a black skull cap on his head that covers most of his face. Finn's sleep-walking episodes has lessened; the sightings fit the night walker's description. His real name, 'Bullard' is now revealed and has been falling in love with an old schoolmate, who he deems as 'the love of his life'. 'Bullard: Suspicious Finn' is the continuation of the novel, 'To Whom It May Concern: The Night Walker' and is filled with bouts of love, lust, deceit, revenge, psycho-sexual behaviour, voyeurism and other episodes of intrigue.

elovelace,Earl Lovelace,While Gods Are Falling,"Exposing the political and cultural failure to address the challenges of postcolonial Trinidad, this insightful novel portrays a world where the working man must face the crime and violence that is destroying the social body. Walter Castle is dissatisfied with his regular job in the Laventille slum in Port of Spain. As the prospect of promotion is bleak and crime and lawless youth become insupportable, he dreams of going back to the village community he grew up in. Unfortunately, the force of nostalgia is not supported by actual memories and as Walter abandons his dreams he is forced to choose between turning into a drone who passes through life without leaving a mark, or standing up for himself. Originally published in 1965, this story remains surprisingly contemporary with its astringent critique of the top-down authoritarianism of nationalist politics.",,elovelace1,1965,English,Peepal Tree Press,,,,Fiction(Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/While-Falling-Caribbean-Modern-Classics/dp/1845231481,#,#,,,,

With over 1.2 billion residents, India is not only the world’s most copious producer of crime pulp, it is also its hungriest consumer. Even in her chirpy feel-good Bollywood films, guns and gangsters vie with the singing and the dancing. Although the work of many Indian writers of crime noir are not to be found in fashionable bookstores—next to the hardcover books of Jhumpa Lahiri, Salman Rushdie, and Vikram Seth—they are in much more popular spots: the stalls and book carts of A. H. Wheeler & Co. found among the 8,000 railway stations that serve India’s 25 million daily commuters, riding 71,000 miles of uneventful track. That is India’s open secret: crime novels stay close to their devouring readers. This needs commemorating.

As famed tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins said, “Music represents nature. Nature represents life. Jazz represents nature. Jazz is life.” So too is Noir a kind of view of life—raw and stripped of pretense, with dark emotions fueling even darker obsessions.

enunez,Elizabeth Nunez,Not For Everyday Use: A Memoir,"Tracing the four days from the moment she gets the call that every immigrant fears to the burial of her mother, Elizabeth Nunez tells the haunting story of her lifelong struggle to cope with the consequences of the ""sterner stuff"" of her parents' ambitions for their children and her mother's seemingly unbreakable conviction that displays of affection are not for everyday use.

But Nunez sympathizes with her parents, whose happiness is constrained by the oppressive strictures of colonialism, by the Catholic Church’s prohibition of artificial birth control which her mother obeys, terrified by the threat of eternal damnation (her mother gets pregnant fourteen times: nine live births and five miscarriages which almost kill her), and by what Malcolm Gladwell refers to as the “privilege of skin color” in his mother’s Caribbean island homeland where “the brown-skinned classes...came to fetishize their lightness.” Still, a fierce love holds this family together, and the passionate, though complex, love Nunez’s parents have for each other will remind readers of the passion between the aging lovers in Gabriel García Márquez’s Love in the Time of Cholera. Written in exquisite prose by a writer the New York Times Book Review calls “a master at pacing and plotting,” Not for Everyday Use is a page-turner that readers will find impossible to put down.",,enunez5,2014,English,Akashic Books,"New York, NY",United States,new_york_ny_united_states,Autobiography/ Memoir,Memoir,n,https://www.amazon.com/Not-Everyday-Use-Elizabeth-Nunez/dp/1617752339,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Not_for_Everyday_Use/UQicAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT8&printsec=frontcover,#,256,-73.98783538,40.67477567,
enunez,Elizabeth Nunez,Prospero's Daughter,"A spellbinding new novel from acclaimed author Elizabeth Nunez, Prospero’s Daughter is a brilliantly conceived retelling of Shakespeare’s The Tempest set on a lush Caribbean island during the height of tensions between the native population and British colonists. Addressing questions of race, class, and power, it is first and foremost the story of a boy and a girl who come of age and violate the ultimate taboo.

Cut off from the main island of Trinidad by a glistening green sea, Chacachacare has few inhabitants besides its colony of lepers and a British doctor who fled England with his three-year-old daughter, Virginia. An amoral genius, Peter Gardner had used his talents to unsavory ends, experimenting, often with fatal results, on unsuspecting patients. Blackmailed by his own brother, Peter ends up on the small island as England’s empire is starting to crumble.

On Chacachacare, Peter experiments chiefly on the wild Caribbean flora–and on the dark-skinned orphan Carlos, whose home he steals. Though Peter considers the boy no better than a savage, he nonetheless schools the child alongside his daughter. But as Carlos and Virginia grow up under the same roof, they become deeply and covertly attached to one another.

When Peter discovers the pair’s secret and accuses Carlos of a heinous crime, it is up to a brusque, insensitive English inspector to discover the truth. During his investigation, a disturbing picture begins to emerge as a monstrous secret is finally drawn into the light.

In some, the sexual exploitation of Caribbean girls and women becomes a metaphor for neocolonialism, a biting rejoinder to enticing travel brochures that depict the Caribbean as a tropical playground and encourage Americans to ""make it your own."" Other tales deal with the sad legacy of colonial history and the ways in which race, skin color, and class complicate relationships between men and women, parents and children. 

But whether writing about childhood or adulthood, life in the islands or life abroad, the writers express their particular concerns with a passion that comes from lived experience, and with a love of place and a feminist sensibility that are accessible to new readers of Caribbean literature as well as to an academic audience. ""What matters is how well we have told our tale, how well we have drawn pictures of the people and places we write about, "" Nunez says. And indeed, this anthology makes those pictures come alive.",,enunez4,2006,English,Seal Press ; Distributed by Publishers Group West,"Emeryville, CA",United States,emeryville_ca_united¬†states,Anthology,,n,https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Blue-Latitudes-Caribbean-Writers/dp/1580051391,#,#,352,28.3988,-78.8515,
enunez,Elizabeth Nunez,Even In Paradise,"Peter Ducksworth, a Trinidadian widower of English ancestry, retires to Barbados, believing he will find an earthly paradise there. He decides to divide his land among his three daughters while he is alive, his intention not unlike that of King Lear, who hoped ""That future strife/May be prevented now."" But Lear made the fatal mistake of confusing flattery with love, and so does Ducksworth. Feeling snubbed by his youngest daughter, Ducksworth decides that only after he dies will she receive her portion of the land. In the meantime, he gives his two older daughters their portions, ironically setting in motion the very strife he hoped to prevent.

Beautifully written in elegant prose, this is a novel about greed, resentment, jealousy, betrayal, and romantic love in the postcolonial world of the Caribbean, giving us a diverse cast of characters of African, Indian, Chinese, Syrian/Lebanese, and English ancestry.",,enunez6,2016,English,"Recorded Books, Inc.","New York, NY",United States,new_york_ny_united_states,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C6D0KFI/ref=x_gr_bb_kindle?caller=Goodreads&tag=x_gr_bb_kindle-20,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Even_in_Paradise/yP8dDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA7&printsec=frontcover,#,322,28.3988,-78.8515,

fmomplaisir,Francesca Momplaisir,The Garden Of Broken Things,"Genevieve, a single mother, flies from New York to Port-au-Prince with her teenage son, Miles. The trip is meant to be an education for fifteen-year-old Miles—a chance to learn about his family’s roots while coming to terms with his father’s departure—but it’s also an excuse for Genevieve to escape the city, where her life is dominated by her failed marriage and the daily pressures of raising Black children in America. For Genevieve, the journey is also a homecoming of sorts: An opportunity to visit the island she remembers from childhood and reconnect with family. But when the country is rocked by a massive earthquake—decimating the city and putting their lives at risk—their visit becomes a nightmare of survival.",,fmomplaisir2,2022,English,Alfred A.

He buys a run-down house in a quickly changing community, and begins life anew. Lucien and Marie-Ange call their home La Kay—“my mother’s house”—and it becomes a place where their fellow immigrants can find peace, a good meal, and necessary legal help. But as a severely emotionally damaged man emigrating from a country whose evils he knows to one whose evils he doesn’t, Lucien soon falls into his worst habits and impulses, with La Kay as the backdrop for his lasciviousness.

What he can’t begin to fathom is that the house is watching, passing judgment, and deciding to put an end to all the sins it has been made to hold. But only after it has set itself aflame will frightened whispers reveal Lucien’s ultimate evil.",,fmomplaisir1,2021,English,Vintage Books,"New York, NY",United States,new_york_ny_united_states,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/My-Mothers-House-Francesca-Momplaisir/dp/0525657150,#,#,304,,,

gphilp,Geoffrey Philp,"Benjamin, My Son","Jason Lumley is in a Miami bar when he sees a newsflash reporting the murder of his politician father, Albert Lumley. With his girlfriend, Nicole, Jason returns to his native Jamaica for the funeral. There the murder is regarded by all as part of the bipartisan warfare which has torn the country apart.

But when Jason meets his old mentor, Papa Legba, the Rastafarian hints at a darker truth. Under the guidance of his locksman Virgil, and redeemed by his love for the Beatrice-like figure of Nicole, Jason enters the several circles of Jamaica's hell. The portrayal of the garrison ghetto area of Standpipe is, in particular, profoundly disturbing.

In his infernal journeyings, Jason encounters both former acquaintances and earlier versions of himself. In the process he confronts conflicting claims on his identity: the Jason shaped by the middle-class colonial traditions of Jamaica College and the Benjamin who was once close to Papa Legba.",,gphilp1,2003,English,Peepal Tree Press,,,,Fiction(Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-My-Son-Geoffrey-Philp-ebook/dp/B0DGQDZN7F?ref_=ast_author_dp&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Zv1-u61M9Cgbrc3NX8IBREHQcyimh_zIdpl7ZuOeHBdqLOf7Yu7dkJbnz9ellal-IpPh3WUkYdW6u395ME6FOSevA41pp4l1Ee3XqvS5rx7euGZRMAg1PffFnrdYqL0RWNIb3wBVS5WSyF3IfyO4kXfHBPRnPLdTAnLzt29Wz6JE3wtiishnXW-lMEBLIH5WLPn464m0o2yq3Fqp8XVlDssIgZCo-U5B9A11owbYJ_c._wd0to1j-_54dCVRLCc017PZmmCmEi7TRlGh1HpxRw0&dib_tag=AUTHOR,https://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-My-Son-Geoffrey-Philp-ebook/dp/B0DGQDZN7F?ref_=ast_author_dp&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Zv1-u61M9Cgbrc3NX8IBREHQcyimh_zIdpl7ZuOeHBdqLOf7Yu7dkJbnz9ellal-IpPh3WUkYdW6u395ME6FOSevA41pp4l1Ee3XqvS5rx7euGZRMAg1PffFnrdYqL0RWNIb3wBVS5WSyF3IfyO4kXfHBPRnPLdTAnLzt29Wz6JE3wtiishnXW-lMEBLIH5WLPn464m0o2yq3Fqp8XVlDssIgZCo-U5B9A11owbYJ_c._wd0to1j-_54dCVRLCc017PZmmCmEi7TRlGh1HpxRw0&dib_tag=AUTHOR&asin=B0DGQDZN7F&revisionId=daeea1e0&format=3&depth=1,#,,,,
gcampbell,George Campbell,First Poems,"First published in 1945, this compilation features the work of Jamaican poet George Campbell. Perceptive and inspirational, these poems consider the events that marked the nationalist struggle for Jamaican independence, such as the imprisonment of militants by British colonial authorities, the appalling social conditions that drove the masses to revolt, and the desperate poverty of the black majority. Honoring martyred heroes of the Jamaican struggle against slavery and colonialism, Campbell writes about the hopes and consolations to be derived from religious faith, but a faith in which Jesus and Lenin were not necessarily incompatible icons. Other, more personal topics, such as love and its ecstasies and bitter disappointments and Jamaica’s natural beauty are also celebrated.",,gcampbell1,1981,English,Garland Publishing Inc.,"New York, NY",United States,new_york_ny_united_states,Poetry Collection,,n,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/184523149X/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=184523149X&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2,#,#,116,,,

Within two years, ghettoization is firmly in place. The emigrants discover the meaning of their marginality in the British Empire in an environment that is unexpectedly hostile and strange.

Drawing on Shakespeare’s The Tempest and C. L. R. James’s The Black Jacobins, as well as his own fiction and poetry, Lamming deftly locates the reader in a specific intellectual and cultural domain while conjuring a rich and varied spectrum of physical, intellectual, psychological, and cultural responses to colonialism. “My subject,” he writes, “is the migration of the West Indian writer, as colonial and exile, from his native kingdom, once inhabited by Caliban, to the tempestuous island of Prospero’s and his language. This book is a report on one man’s way of seeing.”",,glamming6,1960,English,University of Michigan Press,"Ann Arbor, MI",United States,ann_arbor_mi_united¬†states,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Pleasures-Exile-Ann-Arbor-Paperbacks/dp/0472064665,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Pleasures_of_Exile/hUw6Gkhj5IcC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA14&printsec=frontcover,#,260,,,

gjohn,Gus John ,Because They're Black ,"The two authors of this book (one of them is a black social worker and the author of the Handsworth report) have managed to get black people to talk, to 'tell it like it is'. The major part of this book is devoted to careful description of what it feels like to be on the receiving end of the kind of discrimination nearly every one of us exercises. We even look at black people differently, as if they were freaks. In this description is laid bare the way in which the barriers of mutual incomprehension have come to be.
The last section of the book is devoted to the way out. Integration is discussed and shown for what it is: the desire to convert black men into white men. Black power, different in mind but as strong as it's U.S. counterpart, is seen as a humanizing necessity, not only for blacks but for whites too. Political conflict and struggle are essential if we are to change ourselves and our society sufficiently to see not only black men as human but to make ourselves human too.
The appendix by Dr Hashmi on the psychology of racial prejudice shows how those who are finally less than human are those infected by the disease.",,gjohn1,1971,English,Penquin Books,"Harmondsworth, LDN",England,london_england,Fiction (Short Story),,y,https://www.amazon.com/Because-Theyre-Black-Penguin-special/dp/0140522875,#,#,,,,

This anthology draws from those collections, plus a few guests, focusing on work written over the past twenty-five years the majority dealing with the recent post-independence period up to the present. Though quality is the ultimate criteria, this anthology is unrivalled in its range across the Anglophone Caribbean and its diasporas, and representative of Caribbean ethnicities, gender and sexual orientations. Stories offer images of the city from ghettos to gated communities, suburbia, villages, the coastal margins. They display a range of contemporary concerns: social fragmentation, political corruption, sexual politics. They display a range of short story genres from satire, gritty realism, magical realism, fantasy, the gothic, the folkloric, horror, crime, erotica, flash fiction, the speculative Whilst the stories in the anthology collectively offer an insightful picture of both the contemporary Caribbean and of the current status of the Caribbean short story as a form, the overall editorial aim has been to create a book that gives the reader a rich, varied and rewarding reading experience.",,jross1,2018,English,Peepal Tree Press,,,,Anthology,,n,https://www.amazon.com/Peepal-Contemporary-Caribbean-Short-Stories/dp/1845234103,#,#,,,,

Manuel returns to his native village after working on a sugar plantation in Cuba only to discover that it is stricken by a drought and divided by a family feud. He attacks the resignation endemic among his people by preaching the kind of political awareness and solidarity he has learned in Cuba.

Curry Cascadoo tells the story of a tragic period in the life of a Caribbean immigrant to New York. Troubled by loneliness, failing health and a longing for life as he remembers it in his native Trinidad, he struggles desperately to complete work on a novel he’d been writing for many years. As he stumbles towards his ultimate goal, he’s haunted by memories of past relationships and thoughts about the true significance of his life. The story is told in the form of letters, poetry and recollections.

klord,Karen Lord,"New Worlds, Old Ways: Speculative Tales from the Caribbean","The Caribbean has a powerful, modern tradition of fantastic literature that’s on full display in this anthology of original fiction by writers from Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Bermuda . . . None of these writers is likely to be familiar to American audiences, but all are worth getting to know. Readers who love the writing of Nalo Hopkinson, Tobias S. Buckell, and Lord herself will savor this volume.” ―Publishers Weekly, Starred Review

Do not be misled by the ‘speculative’ in the title. Although there may be robots and fantastical creatures, these common symbols are tools to frame the familiar from fresh perspectives. Here you will find the recent past and ongoing present of government and society with curfews, crime, and corruption; the universal themes of family, growth and death, love and hate; the struggle to thrive when power is capricious and revenge too bittersweet. Here too is the passage of everything―old ways, places, peoples, and ourselves―leaving nothing behind but memories, histories, and stories.

This anthology speaks to the fragility of our Caribbean home, but reminds the reader that although home may be vulnerable, it is also beautifully resilient. The voice of our literature declares that in spite of disasters, this people and this place shall not be wholly destroyed.",,klord4,2016,English,Peekash Press,St. Clair,Trinidad & Tobago,st._clair_trinidad_&¬†tobago,Anthology,,n,https://www.amazon.com/New-Worlds-Old-Ways-Speculative/dp/1617755265,https://www.google.com/books/edition/New_Worlds_Old_Ways_Speculative_Tales_fr/0qZoDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA7&printsec=frontcover,#,159,,,

Now a man and a woman from opposite sides of these clashing societies must work together to save this vanishing race—and end up uncovering ancient mysteries with far-reaching ramifications.

Rafi possesses mental abilities that might benefit people . . . or control them. Some wish to help Rafi wield his powers responsibly; others see him as a threat to be contained. Rafi’s only freedom at the Lyceum is Wallrunning: a game of speed and agility played on vast vertical surfaces riddled with variable gravity fields.

Serendipity and Ntenman are also students at the Lyceum, but unlike Rafi, they come from communities where such abilities are valued. Serendipity finds the Lyceum as much a prison as a school, and she yearns for a meaningful life beyond its gates. Ntenman, with his quick tongue, quicker mind, and a willingness to bend if not break the rules, has no problem fitting in. But he too has his reasons for wanting to escape.

Now the three friends are about to experience a moment of violent change as seething tensions between rival star-faring civilizations come to a head. For Serendipity, this change will challenge her ideas of community and self. For Ntenman, it will open new opportunities and new dangers. And for Rafi, given a chance to train with some of the best Wallrunners in the galaxy, it will lead to the discovery that there is more to Wallrunning than he ever suspected . . . and more to himself than he ever dreamed.",,klord3,2014,English,Jo Fletcher Books,London,England,london_ldn_england,Fiction (Novel),Science Fiction,n,https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Game-Novel-Karen-Lord/dp/0345534077,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Galaxy_Game/R03VAgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT8&printsec=frontcover,#,352,,,

lpersaud,Lakshmi Persaud,For The Love Of My Name,"Torn between confession and self-justification, President for Life, Robert Augustus Devonish writes his memoirs as his country falls apart around him; Kamilia prepares for a workers' last stand against his regime; Vasu sets off to investigate the rumours of untold horrors in a commune deep in the interior; and Marguerite Devonish has to decide between loyalty to family or country in bringing to an end her brother's crimes.

Through these and many other unforgettable characters Lakshmi Persaud tells of the last days of the Caribbean island of Maya before it sinks beneath the sea. This challenging novel profoundly dramatises the consequences of ethnic prejudice in a culture of masks which gives licence to individuals to abandon moral responsibility for their actions. Its echoes resonate across the killing fields of Bosnia, Kosova, East Timor - or wherever state power gives free rein to the most primal impulses of kith and kin.

Told through multiple voices, whose tones range through the lyrical, the direct and unvarnished, the conversational and the polished, For the Love of My Name weaves a striking tapestry of hatreds and loves, duty and the degradation of consciousness, despairs and hopes. Above all the bright threads of human resilience glint in the weave.",,lpersaud1,2000,English,Peepal Tree Press,,,,Fiction,,n,https://www.amazon.com/Love-My-Name-Lakshmi-Persaud/dp/1900715422,#,#,,,,

Everyone knows that the family’s lucrative shipping business will go to her cousin, Adam, one day.  But when her grandfather dies, Emily receives an unexpected inheritance: Peverills, a sugar plantation in Barbados—a plantation her grandfather never told anyone he owned. 

When Emily accompanies her cousin and his new wife to Barbados, she finds Peverills a burnt-out shell, reduced to ruins in 1816, when a rising of enslaved people sent the island up in flames. Rumors swirl around the derelict plantation; people whisper of ghosts.

Why would her practical-minded grandfather leave her a property in ruins?  Why are the neighboring plantation owners, the Davenants, so eager to acquire Peverills? The answer lies in the past— a tangled history of lies, greed, clandestine love, heartbreaking betrayal, and a bold bid for freedom.",,lwillig1,2020,English,HarperCollins,,,,Fiction,,n,https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Country-Novel-Lauren-Willig/dp/0062839020,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Summer_Country/kJ1rDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT7&printsec=frontcover,#,,,,

mlopez,Magdalena López,Más Que Islas Antología De Cuentistas Del Gran Caribe Hispano,"Mujeres que sufren acoso y violencia machista cada día y que a veces la normalizan y a veces la resisten. Un profesor gay que termina siendo víctima de una purga castrista como represalia contra una revuelta estudiantil. Una partera que hará todo lo posible para no vender la sexualidad de su hija a los poderosos. Los cantos de sirena de la emigración como promesa de éxito y prosperidad: una familia puertorriqueña que se da de bruces contra uno de los tiroteos que suceden en Estados Unidos todos los años; el joven africano que quería triunfar en el fútbol europeo y termina de mantero frente al estadio Santiago Bernabéu.

Las y los protagonistas de estos relatos, firmados por algunas de las autoras más en forma de la narrativa actual en español, habitan lugares tan distintos (y distantes) como el barrio rojo de Ámsterdam, las calles de La Habana y Santo Domingo, el metro de Madrid o la Ciudad de Panamá del siglo XVII atacada por el sanguinario pirata Morgan, donde el terror y la desdicha se ceban, como siempre, con las más débiles.

Ojalá antologías como esta sirvan para descubrir que el Caribe es mucho más que esa exótica región de playas de arena blanca, hoteles lujosos y ron barato. Aunque una de estas historias le suceda al cojo que vive de estafar a los turistas y no siempre salga bien parado.",,mlopez1,2019,Spanish,Mérida La Moderna,,,,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/849499087X/ref=x_gr_bb_amazon?ie=UTF8&tag=x_gr_bb_amazon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=849499087X&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2,#,#,,,,

The tensions wrought by rapid change and conflicting loyalties are at the heart of these stories, most beautifully evoked in the novella ""Arrival of the Snake-Woman"". Here a young boy narrates the seminal event of his childhood in the late nineteenth century: the coming of a lonely Indian indentured woman into a mountain village.

Senior's stories are leavened with wit and humour and the intricate play with language and her characters emerge as triumphant examples of the human spirit unravelling the complex weave of race, class, and cultural and ethnic identity",,osenior12,2009,English,TSAR Publications,Toronto,Canada,toronto_canada,Fiction (Short Story Collection),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Arrival-Snake-Woman-Other-Stories-Senior/dp/1894770536?ref_=ast_author_dp&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.vIecXfNoJhuE_f-65GrV_7hk7zh-N1CwoS0ajLWOp5KWU-izWz5c2P0y6SkmM4bEZQ3OmChiW3EabMNsmfU336s5IapBxniyCq6gRnO4MIyQTz8Y3_JHH4F_uaNn3wa_FIXjlHNtGeuj-rP1u9102rfcHUzbpM49TUZqD9AB80svLJsWrDVJGXza4fwEl7Tl_QOF6Re_ICh0Jm5tYnjn94CJGOZizQ9_lnlhzqlSxlc.J3OWFvkwTBNSLEGEoDBkqYAFEg5E-lS-jkZ7AwXzZrY&dib_tag=AUTHOR,#,#,169,,,

osenior,Olive Senior,Dying To Better Themselves: West Indians And The Building Of The Panama Canal,"The popular West Indian migration narrative often starts with the “Windrush Generation”in 1950s’ England, but in Dying to Better Themselves Olive Senior examines an earlier narrative: that of the neglected post-emancipation generation of the 1850s who were lured to Panama by the promise of lucrative work and who initiated a pattern of circular migration that would transform the islands economically, socially and politically well into the twentieth century.

West Indians provided the bulk of the workforce for the construction of the Panama Railroad and the Panama Canal, and between 1850 and 1914 untold numbers sacrificed their lives, limbs and mental faculties to the Panama project. Many West Indians remained as settlers, their descendants now citizens of Panama; many returned home with enough of a nest egg to better themselves; and others launched themselves elsewhere in the Americas as work beckoned.

Senior tells the compelling story of the West Indian rite of passage of “going to Panama” and captures the complexities behind the iconic “Colón Man”. Drawing on official records, contemporary newspapers, journals and books, songs, sayings, and literature, and the words of the participants themselves, Senior answers the questions of who went to Panama, how and why; she describes the work they did there, the conditions under which they lived, and the impact on their homelands when they returned or on the host societies when they stayed.

Many books have shown how the “conquest” of the Isthmus of Panama by land and sea revolutionized the modern world. Dying to Better Themselves distinguishes itself by exploring how the myriad individuals touched by the construction of the railroad and the canal changed their Caribbean world as well.",,osenior16,2014,English,University of The West Indies Press,Mona,Jamaica,mona_jamaica,Nonfiction,"Migration,Labor",n,https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Better-Themselves-Indians-Building/dp/9766404577,#,#,416,,,

We hear from poor folk making the best of past hardships (""Coal""); rich folk plotting future selfishness (""The Goodness of My Heart""); and a young girl, forced to shoulder her mother's burdens in addition to her own (""Lollipop"").

olplazo,Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo,Cuba In Splinters: Eleven Stories From The New Cuba,"Think Cuba, you’re likely to think bearded revolutionaries in fatigues. Salsa. Sugar cane.

Rock ‘n’ roll, zombies, drugs – anomie and angst – do not generally figure in our mental images of a country that’s assumed an outsized place in the American imagination. But fresh from the tropics, in ""Cuba in Splinters"" – a sparkling package of stories we’re assured are fictional – that’s exactly what you’ll find. Eleven writers largely unknown outside Cuba depict a world that veers from a hyperreal Havana in decay, against a backdrop of oblivious drug-toting German tourists, to a fantasy land – or is it? – where vigilant Cubans bar the door to zombies masquerading as health inspectors. Sex and knife-fights, stutterers and addicts, losers and lost literary classics: welcome to a raw and genuine island universe closed to casual visitors.",,olplazo1,2014,English,OR Books,,,,Fiction (Short Story Collection),,y,https://www.amazon.com/Cuba-Splinters-Eleven-Stories-New/dp/1939293480,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Cuba_in_Splinters/I5JIDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT7&printsec=frontcover,#,,,,
opatterson,Orlando Patterson,An Absence Of Ruins,"An Absence of Ruins is a poignant portrayal of a man shaped by the colonial education of the Caribbean intellectual class. Orlando Patterson offers a devastating critique of middle-class intellectualism through the self-condemning perceptions of the main character, Alexander Blackman, and the vibrant reality of the world he is unable to embrace—the world of the Jamaican working class. An intensive and inward portrayal of what the world looks like to a man who has been shaped by the deeply entrenched consequences of colonialism, this novel is full of sardonic humor and a nihilism that emerges as a kind of integrity.",,opatterson2,1967,English,Hutchinson,,,,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Absence-Ruins-Caribbean-Modern-Classics/dp/184523104X,#,#,,,,
opatterson,Orlando Patterson,The Children Of Sisyphus,"A bleak portrayal of life on the Dungle—the rubbish heap where the very poorest squat—this beautifully poetic, existentialist novel turns an unwavering eye to life in the Jamaican ghetto. By interweaving the stories of Dinah, a prostitute who can never quite escape the circumstances of her life, and Brother Solomon, a respected Rastafarian leader who allows his followers to think that a ship is on its way to take them home to Ethiopia, this brutally poetic story creates intense and tragic characters who struggle to come to grips with the absurdity of life. As these downtrodden protagonists shed their illusions and expectations, they realize that there is no escape from meaninglessness, and eventually gain a special kind of dignity and stoic awareness about life and the universe.",,opatterson1,1964,English,Peepal Tree Press,,,,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Children-Sisyphus-Caribbean-Modern-Classics/dp/1845230949,#,#,,,,
oggoyco,Osvaldo García Goyco,Tales of the Taíno Gods: How The Caribbean Sea Was Born,"Tales of the Taíno Gods: How The Caribbean Sea Was Born, is an entertaining fantasy, based on the mysterious
mythological world of the Taíno Indians of Puerto Rico and the Greater Antilles. The plot is inspired by the writings of Friar
Ramón Pané’s An Account of the Antiquities of the Indians (1494-98), which was part of Christopher Columbus’ diary.
The illustrations of the tale were painted using a visual script by the author, who directed the skillful brush of the late young puertorrican painter Juan Negrón.

tmcwatt,Tessa McWatt,Vital Signs,"Vital Signs is a novel that takes us deep inside a marriage in crisis, teasing out the unspoken rules that run - or ruin - love relationships. So much is taken for granted in a long marriage, so much is relied upon, so much is resented, so much is never spoken. But when Anna, Mike's beautiful and self-possessed wife, begins to mangle her sentences as a result of a brain aneurysm that could kill her at any moment, it's as if Mike has woken from a long dream in which he was only thinking about himself. Or is he still only thinking about himself? In his panic to show his wife that she has been his entire universe, will he finally confess all the ways in which he rebelled against her power over him, the way he betrayed her? Incoherent with guilt, he uses his talent as a graphic artist to draw his way closer to his wife, trying to communicate with her, and himself too, through signs and symbols. Mike is deeply flawed, hovering on the knife-edge of a confession, selfishly looking to the woman he loves for absolution even as she faces the possibility of her own death. And through this portrait of a marriage in crisis, Tessa McWatt leads us deftly and deeply into the workings of a relationship that blooms and withers and reblooms over time, and into the lies and the truths necessary to sustain it.",,tmcwatt6,2012,English,Random House Canada,Toronto,Canada,toronto_canada,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Vital-Signs-Tessa-McWatt/dp/0434021067?ref_=ast_author_dp&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gPMEGoM27mBBQKaHhFGrQfTZRSn_MYUSbPAKcJL6JseSC0Qy-a7FY8kTlKb2iVaDe4fIyCx6Jvip2-iJsK6_USkGURAf9LIbITuHgMD6zfdq8gL2w3rhrdX3JAVrkXG0LrrX3u2hupy3elDPC-ks3Q.iF61B2rSvpQnw4v3AeyMF-JiTGgdWBF6t7ZA7x389J4&dib_tag=AUTHOR,#,#,176,,,
tmcwatt,Tessa McWatt,The Snow Line,"Northern India, 2009. Four travellers disembark from the Dhauladhar Express at the Pathankot train station, having arrived in Punjab to attend a wedding. Yosh, 30, a yoga teacher from Vancouver; Monica, 30, the bride's cousin from Toronto; Reema, 26, the bride's childhood friend, a mixed-heritage Londoner in search of her Indianness; and Jackson, 86, who is returning to India after a long hiatus in Boston, and who carries with him a small tea canister in which he has placed his wife Amelia's ashes.

As they gather with other guests at the traditional Indian wedding, Jackson and Reema develop a reluctant, unlikely friendship that grows through mutual need and a slowly developing trust, and together with Yosh and Monica, they embark on a post-wedding journey to the Himalayas, seeking the perfect place to scatter Amelia's ashes. As they travel together, secrets are revealed, and each of them is opened up to more questions than answers.

These intergenerational and intercultural relationships are a meeting of the past and the future, a reconciliation of past wrongs and a possibility that the future might be less violent, less selfish, less segregated.

Tessa McWatt knows first-hand that the answer to this question, often asked of people of colour by white people, is always more complicated than it seems. Is the answer English, Scottish, British, Caribbean, Portuguese, Indian, Amerindian, French, African, Chinese, Canadian? Like most families, hers is steeped in myth and the anecdotes of grandparents and parents who recount their histories through the lens of desire, aspiration, loss, and shame.

In Shame On Me she unspools all the interwoven strands of her multicoloured inheritance, and knits them back together using additional fibres from literature and history to strengthen the weave of her refabricated tale. She dismantles her own body and examines it piece by piece to build a devastating and incisively subtle analysis of the race debate as it now stands, in this stunningly written exploration of who and what we truly are.",,tmcwatt10,2019,English,Scribe UK,London,England,(london)_england,Autobiography,,n,https://www.amazon.com/Shame-Me-anatomy-race-belonging/dp/1911617966,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Shame_on_Me/m2KlDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA3&printsec=frontcover,#,272,,,
tmcwatt,Tessa McWatt,Where Are You Agnes?,"Agnes Martin was born on the Canadian prairies in the early twentieth century. In this imagining of her childhood from acclaimed author Tessa McWatt, Agnes spends her days surrounded by wheat fields, where her grandfather encourages her to draw what she sees and feels around her: the straight horizon, the feeling of the sun, the movement of birds’ wings and the shapes she sees in the wheat.

One day, Agnes’s family moves to a house in a big city. The straight horizon and wheat fields are gone, but Agnes continues to draw what she sees and feels around her. No one except her grandfather understands what she is trying to capture ― not her mother, who asks, “Where are you, Agnes?” when she sees her daughter engrossed in her drawing; nor her siblings, who think her art is ugly. Still, Agnes keeps trying to capture what she sees inside her mind.

Agnes Martin grew up to become a famous abstract expressionist artist. Tessa McWatt has written a beautiful story of Agnes’s childhood and how it might have shaped her adult work. Zuzanna Celej’s watercolors adeptly capture Agnes’s world, including hints of the grid paintings that she was later known for, against the backdrop of prairie and city landscapes.

Includes an author’s note with more information about Agnes Martin’s life and the inspiration behind this story.",,tmcwatt11,2020,English,Groundwood Books,Toronto,Canada,toronto_canada,Short Story,Picture Book,n,https://www.amazon.com/Where-Are-Agnes-Tessa-McWatt/dp/1773061402,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Where_Are_You_Agnes/y_vADwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT2&printsec=frontcover,#,44,,,

umarson,Una Marson,Pocomania and London calling,"Two plays from one of Jamaica’s most important feminists and dramatists. This first publication of Una Marson’s insightful and engaging dramatic work is long overdue. Pocomania is among the most important Caribbean plays ever written. First staged at the dawn of the region’s stride toward nationalism and independence, it heralded a new era of Jamaican and Caribbean drama, one unafraid of taking a serious look at the people, the culture, and the language. The play was the first to seriously deal with Jamaican Creole and the Jamaican religious form of Pocomania. Though London Calling features citizens from a fictional country, the play explores the all too real anxieties surrounding race, class, identity and migration in early twentieth century London. These plays grapple with class, race, gender, language and culture as they explore the tensions at the nexus of prejudice and the performance of blackness.",,umarson3,2016,English,Blouse & Skirt Books,Kingston,Jamaica,kingston_jamaica,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Pocomania-London-Calling-Una-Marson/dp/9768267038,#,#,154,,,

vriley,Vanessa Riley,Island Queen: A Novel,"Born into slavery on the tiny Caribbean island of Montserrat, Doll bought her freedom—and that of her sister and her mother—from her Irish planter father and built a legacy of wealth and power as an entrepreneur, merchant, hotelier, and planter that extended from the marketplaces and sugar plantations of Dominica and Barbados to a glittering luxury hotel in Demerara on the South American continent.

Vanessa Riley’s novel brings Doll to vivid life as she rises above the harsh realities of slavery and colonialism by working the system and leveraging the competing attentions of the men in her life: a restless shipping merchant, Joseph Thomas; a wealthy planter hiding a secret, John Coseveldt Cells; and a roguish naval captain who will later become King William IV of England.

From the bustling port cities of the West Indies to the forbidding drawing rooms of London’s elite, Island Queen is a sweeping epic of an adventurer and a survivor who answered to no one but herself as she rose to power and autonomy against all odds, defying rigid eighteenth-century morality and the oppression of women as well as people of color. It is an unforgettable portrait of a true larger-than-life woman who made her mark on history.",,vriley1,20222,English,William Morrow Paperbacks,,,,Fiction (Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/Island-Queen-Novel-Vanessa-Riley/dp/0063002841,https://www.google.com/books/edition/Island_Queen/SBgBEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA1727&printsec=frontcover,#,,,,

walewis,W. Arthur Lewis,The Evolution Of The International Economic Order,"Do rich industrial nations underestimate the threat to their economic stability posed by demands for a new international economic order? Are the developing countries wrong to assume that their economic advancement depends on a transfer of wealth from the richer nations? Sir W. Arthur Lewis’s provocative analysis of the present economic order and its origins suggests that the answer to both questions is yes.

Professor Lewis perceptively illuminates aspects of recent economic history that have often been overlooked by observers of international affairs. He asks first how the world came to be divided into countries exporting manufactures and countries exporting primary commodities. High agricultural productivity and a good investment climate allowed countries in Northwest Europe to industrialize rapidly, while the favorable terms of trade they enjoyed assured them and the temperate lands to which Europeans migrated of continuing dominance over the tropical countries.

At the core of the author’s argument lies the contention that as the structure of international trade changes, the tropical countries move rapidly toward becoming net importers of agricultural commodities and net exporters of manufactures. Even so, they continue to depend on the markets of the richer countries for their growth, and they continue to trade on unfavorable terms. Both of these disadvantages, he concludes, stem from large agricultural sectors with low productivity and will disappear only as the technology of tropical food production is revolutionized.",,walewis1,1955,English,Princeton University Press,"Princeton, NJ",United States,princeton_nj_united¬†states,Nonfiction Book,,n,https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691637914/the-evolution-of-the-international-economic-order?srsltid=AfmBOorD2HGlXBvhxVZuErzCPvldRj7XQN1n9v-wAeBIHtiFwVZIbvhY,https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Evolution_of_the_International_Econo/OWl9BgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA3&printsec=frontcover,#,60,,,

ylahens,Yanick Lahens,Aunt Résia and the Spirits and Other Stories,"The men and women glimpsed in Lahens's stories are confronted with the overwhelming task of simply staying alive. ""The Survivors"" unfolds under the Duvalier dictatorship. The story, centered on a group of men who dream of somehow striking out against the regime, shows how fear is passed down from generation to generation. Life is no simpler in the post-Duvalier world of the title story, in which a young man is caught between a mother who lives a devout life filled with self-imposed restrictions and an aunt who religiously serves the spirits of Vodou but makes no apologies for working in the black market. The twelve-year-old girl who narrates ""Madness Had Come with the Rain"" finds herself swept up in a violent riot following the death of a modern Robin Hood. Lahens’s women, although they may act as the poto mitan (or ""central pole"") in family life and society, experience a particularly grim fate. In the eviction tale ""And All This Unease"" a beautiful girl reminisces about her happy childhood in the country in order to forget her current life as a prostitute.",,ylahens1,1994,English,University of Virginia Press,,,,Fiction (Short Story Collection),,n,https://www.amazon.com/R%C3%A9sia-Spirits-Other-Stories-CARAF/dp/0813929016,#,#,,,,

yIrizarry,Ylce Irizarry,Doubly Troubling Narratives,"Since the 'boom' of US ethnic writing, a number of writers have published novels dealing with the colonial-era Hispanic Caribbean. US-authored novels such as The Agüero Sisters (Cristina García, 1998) have received little critical attention in the USA. Similarly, English language novels written by Hispanic Caribbean authors such as The House on the Lagoon (Rosario Ferré, 1996) have received even less, if not hostile, critical attention from Caribbean scholars. Both novels locate the origins of Caribbean modernity in the violent movement from Iberian colonialism to US neo-colonialism. By comparing these novels' narrative concerns about writing, history and race, the complex relationship between 'possibility' and 'violence' they depict is delineated. Such texts reflect a growing corpus of historical fiction about the Hispanic Caribbean and complicate the flawed and persistent schism between US Latina and Latin American literary traditions.",,yIrizarry1,2006,English,Sage Publications,,,,Fiction(Novel),,n,#,https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/eng_facpub/271/,#,,,,

Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of England’s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesn’t quite match her name (Jamaican for “no problem”). Samad’s late-in-life arranged marriage (he had to wait for his bride to be born), produces twin sons whose separate paths confound Iqbal’s every effort to direct them, and a renewed, if selective, submission to his Islamic faith.",,zsmith1,2000,English,"Random House Digital, Inc.",,,,Fiction(Novel),,n,https://www.amazon.com/White-Teeth-Novel-Zadie-Smith/dp/0375703861,https://www.google.com/books/edition/White_Teeth/zZFlmid0HOYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA1&printsec=frontcover,#,,,,
